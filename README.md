ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @juusoviita

I'm working on my own React & Django (Rest Framework) projects.
The aim is to build a representable portfolio and who knows, maybe get a job!

I've completed two of the Harvard's CS courses on edX:
-  CS50's Introduction to Computer Science,
-  CS50's Web Programming with Python to JavaScript.
